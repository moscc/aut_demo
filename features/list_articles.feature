Feature: List articles on the landing page
  As a visitor
  In order to stay up to date with current affairs
  I would like to see a list of all articles when I visit the News Service

Scenario: User can view list of articles
  Given the following articles exist in the database
    |title                  | content             |
    |A breaking news article| Lorem ipsum...      |
    |Another article        | Lorem ipsum ipsum...|

  Given I visit the site
  Then I should see "A breaking news article"
  And I should see "Lorem ipsum..."
  And I should see "Another article"
  And I should see "Lorem ipsum ipsum..."
